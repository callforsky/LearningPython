@ Sequence
tuple: number = (1, 2, 3, 4) # cannot be modified
>>> len(number)
4

list: number2 = [1, 2, 3, 4] # can be modified

A tuple can contain tuples as elements.

@ Recursive list

Comment: Well, this is a simpler lecture that introduces the sequence and how to insert tuples inside a tuple. Not many to write about.
