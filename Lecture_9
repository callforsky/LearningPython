@Test-Driven Environment

Write the test before you write the function.
A test will clarify the domain, range, and behavior of a function.

Examples:
1)
def gcd(m, n):
    """Returns the largest k that divides both m and n
    k, m, n are all positive integers.
    
    >>> gcd(12, 8)
    4
    """
    if m == n:  # we can improvd the code: if m % n == 0
        return m
    elif m < n:
        return gcd(n, m)
    else:
        return gcd(m-n, n)
