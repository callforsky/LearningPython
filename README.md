LearningPython
==============

This repository records my progress of learning python.

I already started learning python since spring 2014. However, due to time constraint and my low productivity, I stopped
helplessly on lesson 43 on Learning Python the Hard Way. I found some embedded ideas have to be understood before I go on
the course on Learning Python the Hard Way. So I turn to study Berkeley's online CS61A.

Hopefully I will be able to understand philosophy of coding, after learning online CS61A. This repository basically will
store my practice codes or coding homeworks based on online CS61A (https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa13/), probably mixed some codes from Learning Python the Hard
Way.

Basically there are around 30 videos on online CS61A. I plan to finish at least 20 videos by 8/1. I submitted a detailed
schedule below, in hope for pushing me forward on time.
