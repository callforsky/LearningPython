LearningPython
==============

This repository records my progress of learning python.

I already started learning python since spring 2014. However, due to time constraint and my low productivity, I stopped
helplessly on lesson 43 on Learning Python the Hard Way. I found some embedded ideas have to be understood before I go on
the course on Learning Python the Hard Way. So I turn to study Berkeley's online CS61A.

Hopefully I will be able to understand philosophy of coding, after learning online CS61A. This repository basically will
store my practice codes or coding homeworks based on online CS61A, probably mixed some codes from Learning Python the Hard
Way.

Basically there are around 30 videos on online CS61A. I plan to finish at least 20 videos by 8/1. I submitted a detailed
schedule below, in hope for pushing me forward on time.
